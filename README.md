# NTUEat
A simple application made using Python and Pygame, to help recommend food options to users based on user preferences.

This project was made in Year 1 Sem 1 for module - "Introduction to Computational Thinking"
It is split up to 3 areas:
Database, Functions and Interface

The database stored all the necessary information we needed about the canteens, such as the price range, cuisine, location etc. 

The functions are created to do tasks such as calculation of distance between the user's location and the canteen, or to 
display the map of the school, and the transport distances etc.

Interface was created by Pygame and it displayed the food options, maps, locations etc.
